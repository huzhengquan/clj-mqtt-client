# clj-mqtt-client

Clojure MQTT client, based on [mqtt-client](https://github.com/fusesource/mqtt-client), Applications can use a blocking API style, a futures based API, or a callback/continuations passing API style.

## Installation

Leiningen dependency information:

```clojure
[huzhengquan/clj-mqtt-client "0.1.6"]
```

## Usage

### Using the Blocking API

```clojure
(require '[clj-mqtt-client.blocking :as mqtt])

(let [conn (mqtt/connect :uri "tcp://0.0.0.0:1886"
                         :user-name "xxx"
                         :password "xxx"
                         :client-id "xxx")]
  ; publish message
  (mqtt/publish conn "topic" (.getBytes "payload"))
  ; publish opts
  (mqtt/publish conn "topic" (.getBytes "payload") :qos 1 :retain false)
  ; subscribe
  (mqtt/subscribe conn [["topic1" 1] ["topic2" 2]])
  ; receive
  (loop []
    (let [{:keys [topic payload]} (mqtt/receive conn)]
      ; topic ^String "topic1"
      ; payload ^bytes xxx 
      (println topic (new String payload "utf-8"))
      )
    (recur))
  ; disconnect
  (mqtt/disconnect conn)
  ; unsubscribe
  (mqtt/unsubscribe conn ["topic1" "topic2"])
  ; connected?
  (mqtt/connected? conn)
  )
```

### Using the Callback/Continuation Passing based API

```clojure
(require '[clj-mqtt-client.callback :as mqtt])

; create connection
(let [conn (mqtt/connect :uri "tcp://0.0.0.0:1886"
                         :user-name "xxx"
                         :password "xxx"
                         :client-id "xxx"
                         :listener-on-publish (fn [^String topic ^byte payload] 
                                                ; new message
                                                )
                         )]
  ; publish message
  (mqtt/publish conn "topic" (.getBytes "payload"))
  ; publish opts
  (mqtt/publish conn "topic" (.getBytes "payload") :qos 1 :retain false)
  ; subscribe
  (mqtt/subscribe conn [["topic" 1] ["topic2" 2]])
  ; disconnect
  (mqtt/disconnect conn)
  )
```

### Using the Future based API

```clojure
(require '[clj-mqtt-client.future :as mqtt])

; create connection
(let [conn (mqtt/future-connection :uri "tcp://0.0.0.0:1886" ...)]

  ; connect
  (let [f (mqtt/connect conn)]
    (.await f))
  ; publish
  (let [f (mqtt/publish conn "topic" (.getBytes "payload"))]
    (.await f))
  ; subscribe
  (let [f (mqtt/subscribe conn [["topic" 1] ["topic2" 2]])]
    (.await f))
  ; receive
  (let [f (mqtt/receive conn)
        msg (mqtt/read-message f)]
    ; ...
    )
  ; disconnect
  (let [f (mqtt/disconnect conn)]
    (.await f))
  )
```
